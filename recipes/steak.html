<h3>Butcher (or hanger) steak is great pan cooked, broiled, or grilled. It takes to marinades wonderfully, and really can be substituted for any cut of steak. Just be sure to take the time to trim it well.</h3>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 (2 pound) butcher's steak</li>
<li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
<li>1 tablespoon clarified butter</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Remove all silver skin and extra fat from the steak. Carefully cut out the connective tissue that connects the 2 halves of the steak, separating the whole into 2 long pieces. Cut lobe of meat from one half (it's a piece that is slightly separated from the larger half). Then cut each of the 2 larger halves into 2 steaks each. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
</ol>
